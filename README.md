# TensorFlow and Keras: Sentiment Analysis Using RNN


This project uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the sentiment behind customer reviews. Specifically, it focuses on Amazon product reviews and determines whether a review is positive, negative, or somewhere in between. The goal is to predict the star rating of a review just by analyzing the text.

### What Is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment Analysis is a way of using computers to automatically figure out if a piece of text (like a product review) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. For example, if someone writes "I love this product!", the sentiment is positive. If they write "This product is terrible," the sentiment is negative.

### What Is RNN?

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to understand sequences, like sentences or time-series data. RNNs are especially good at processing language because they can remember what has been said earlier in a sentence while interpreting the later parts.

### What Did We Do?

1. **Collected Data**: We used a dataset of Amazon product reviews, which includes both the text of the review and the star rating given by the customer.

2. **Processed the Text**: Before feeding the text to our model, we needed to clean it up and convert it into a form that the computer can understand. This involved:
   - Breaking down the reviews into individual words (tokenization).
   - Converting these words into numbers (since computers work with numbers).
   - Making sure all reviews are the same length by padding them (adding zeros where necessary).

3. **Built the Model**: We created an RNN model using TensorFlow and Keras. This model was designed to:
   - Take in the processed text.
   - Learn patterns that indicate whether a review is likely to have a high or low rating.
   - Predict a rating (1 to 5 stars) for new reviews.

4. **Trained the Model**: We fed the model thousands of reviews along with their ratings. The model used this data to learn how to predict ratings on its own.

5. **Tested the Model**: After training, we tested the model on new reviews that it hadn't seen before to see how well it could predict the correct rating.

6. **Made Predictions**: We created a simple function that allows you to input a new review, and the model will predict the star rating for that review.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:
- A computer with Python installed.
- Basic knowledge of how to run Python scripts.
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries, which are used for building and running the AI model.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TravelXML/TENSORFLOW-AND-KERAS-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-USING-RNN.git
   cd TENSORFLOW-AND-KERAS-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-USING-RNN
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install all the necessary Python libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: This project is built using Jupyter Notebook, an easy-to-use interface for running Python code.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook rnn_az_senti_analysis.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the Steps**: The notebook guides you through each step, from processing the data to training the model and making predictions.

3. **Make Predictions**: You can test the model with your own reviews by running the prediction function provided.

   ```python
   rating = predict_review_rating("This product is fantastic!")
   print(f"The predicted rating is: {rating}")
   ```

### Example Output

- **Input**: "Worst product ever!"
- **Predicted Rating**: 1 star

- **Input**: "Amazing quality, highly recommend!"
- **Predicted Rating**: 5 stars

## Understanding the Results

After running the model, youâ€™ll get predictions for the sentiment of reviews. The model will predict how many stars a review is likely to get based on the words it contains. This can be incredibly useful for businesses wanting to automatically sort or respond to customer feedback.

### A Few Simple Concepts:
- **Machine Learning**: Teaching a computer to recognize patterns in data.
- **Neural Network**: A computer system modeled after the human brain that learns from data.
- **Training**: The process of feeding data to a model so it can learn from it.
- **Prediction**: Using a trained model to guess outcomes on new, unseen data.

Happy Coding!
